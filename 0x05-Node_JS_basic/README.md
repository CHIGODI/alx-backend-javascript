# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Description

This project introduces the fundamentals of Node.js, focusing on basic JavaScript execution, file handling, and creating HTTP servers using Node.js and Express. The project includes tasks that require you to write scripts that perform various operations such as reading from files, interacting with standard input/output, and creating HTTP servers that handle requests.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Node.js.
- Learn how to execute JavaScript code with Node.js.
- Handle standard input and output in Node.js.
- Read and manipulate files synchronously and asynchronously in Node.js.
- Create HTTP servers using Node.js's `http` module and Express.
- Organize code in a Node.js project for maintainability.

## Project Structure

- **0-console.js**: Contains a function that prints a string to the standard output.
- **1-stdin.js**: A program that interacts with the user via the command line, reads input, and prints responses.
- **2-read_file.js**: A script that reads a CSV file synchronously and prints the number of students in various fields.
- **3-read_file_async.js**: Similar to `2-read_file.js`, but reads the CSV file asynchronously using Promises.
- **4-http.js**: A simple HTTP server that responds with a greeting message.
- **5-http.js**: An HTTP server that responds with a list of students, reading data from a CSV file.
- **6-http_express.js**: An HTTP server using the Express framework that responds with a greeting message.
- **7-http_express.js**: An Express-based HTTP server that lists students from a CSV file, similar to `5-http.js`.
- **full_server**: A more complex Express server organized into controllers, routes, and utilities, capable of handling various student-related requests.

## Requirements

- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- A terminal or command-line interface.
- Familiarity with JavaScript and basic command-line operations.
