# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

This project focuses on practicing ES6 data manipulation techniques in JavaScript. It includes various tasks involving arrays, typed arrays, and ES6 data structures like Set and Map.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Basic list of objects

Creates an array of student objects with attributes like id, firstName, and location.

### 1. More mapping

Returns an array of student IDs from a list of student objects.

### 2. Filter

Filters students based on their location and returns an array of objects for a specific city.

### 3. Reduce

Calculates the sum of all student IDs from a list of student objects.

### 4. Combine

Updates student grades for a specific city based on provided grade data.

### 5. Typed Arrays

Creates a new Int8 typed array and handles errors if the position is out of range.

### 6. Set Data Structure

Converts an array into a Set and returns it.

### 7. More Set Data Structure

Checks if all elements of an array exist in a given Set and returns a boolean.

### 8. Clean Set

Returns a string of values from a Set that start with a specific string.

### 9. Map Data Structure

Returns a map of grocery items with their quantities.

### 10. More Map Data Structure

Updates quantities of items in a grocery list map where the initial quantity is 1.

### 11. Weak Map Data Structure (Advanced)

Tracks API query counts using WeakMap and throws an error if the endpoint load exceeds 5 queries.
