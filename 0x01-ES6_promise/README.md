# JavaScript Promises Project

# Project Structure

The project is organized into several files, each addressing specific tasks:

- **0-promise.js**: Basic implementation of a promise.
- **1-promise.js**: Promise that resolves or rejects based on a boolean parameter.
- **2-then.js**: Function handling responses from a promise.
- **3-all.js**: Handling multiple promises using `Promise.all`.
- **4-user-promise.js**: Promise that resolves with user information.
- **5-photo-reject.js**: Promise that rejects with an error message.
- **6-final-user.js**: Integrates promises from user creation and photo upload.
- **7-load_balancer.js**: Selects the faster promise between two downloads.
- **8-try.js**: Function with try-catch for dividing two numbers.
- **9-try.js**: Function managing error handling around a math function.
